## TODO ##
- [ ] Make it work (v2 support)  
- [x] Thread-safe (~~Stupid stack depth & jmpbuf~~)  
- [ ] Static library (?)  
- [ ] Compatibility (EVEN CAN NOT COMPILE on my RPi2)  
- [ ] Performance (Current: 1.216x slower than JS)  
- [x] Make one of my own (see HiveMiner)  
- [ ] My initial intention (https://github.com/cazala/coin-hive-stratum/issues/140)
